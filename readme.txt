MP3 Organiser

The point of this tool is to find mp3s in a folder and read their ID3 tags. The point is then to reorganise the folders/filenames based on Album/Artist/Title/Song Number info.

One irritating feature is that the ability to detect if an album is part of a compilation is not available. Yet. So Compilation albums will spawn many different Folders based on artist.
Files with incomplete ID3 info will result in files renamed with "Unknown" in place of the missing fields.
